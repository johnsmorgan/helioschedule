timezone: 8.0 # hours relative to UTC -- local solar noon closest to local civil noon will be found for

              # as a unique identifier of each day's observing. Actual observations for that day will be
              # scheduled within solarOffset seconds of the local solar noon.

fields: 
  # here we specify 3 points along the CME front with 2*pi*31.3deg*radians(20) of separation between
  # them. For now, just a single frequency is used. If multiple frequencies are to be observed,
  # then additional 'fields' should be added for each frequency, such that the total number of fields
  # is the product of the number of targets and the number of frequencies.
