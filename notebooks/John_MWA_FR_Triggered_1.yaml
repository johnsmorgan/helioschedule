timezone: 8.0 # hours relative to UTC -- local solar noon closest to local civil noon will be found for 
              # each day. The local date (YYYY-MM-DD) of each local solar noon in UTC will be used
              # as a unique identifier of each day's observing. Actual observations for that day will be
              # scheduled within solarOffset seconds of the local solar noon.
